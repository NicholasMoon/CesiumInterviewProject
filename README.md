# CesiumInterviewProject

By: Nick Moon

The task for this assignment was to calculate the surface distance traversed from one point to another while considering
height field data applied to a two dimensional grid plane.

To use, open up Visual Studio and create a new empty project. Add this file to project source directory, as well as the folder containing the
height map data that was included in the assignment (the st. helens data). No additional setup should be necessary to run (i.e. no external libraries)
